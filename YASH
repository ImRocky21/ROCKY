Yash (born 8 January 1986) is an Indian actor who works in Kannada films. He is the recipient of three Filmfare Awards South.[1][2][3]

Yash began his career with appearances in several television series in the 2000s. He made his film debut in 2007 with Jambada Hudugi. The 2008 romantic drama Moggina Manasu, for which he received the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, proved to be a breakthrough role for Yash. His first film in a leading role, Rocky (2008), was poorly received and a box office flop. He followed it up with a series of romance films that were commercial successes and received his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor nomination for Drama in 2012.

Yash went on to establish himself as a leading actor of Kannada cinema with the college romance Googly (2013), comedy-drama Raja Huli (2013), fantasy action Gajakesari (2014), romantic comedy Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari (2014), action film Masterpiece (2015) and action romance Santhu Straight Forward (2016). Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari ranks among the highest-grossing Kannada releases and gave Yash his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The pan-India success of Prashanth Neel's 2018 period action film K.G.F: Chapter 1, which became the highest-grossing Kannada film, helped Yash attain nationwide recognition in India and win his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor. He won further praise for his performance in the sequel, K.G.F: Chapter 2 (2022), which currently ranks as the fourth highest-grossing Indian film.

Yash promotes various social and philanthropic causes through the Yasho Marga Foundation. He is married to the actress Radhika Pandit.

Early life and television roles
Yash was born on 8 January 1986 in Boovanahalli, a village in Hassan, Karnataka.[4][5] He was given two names: Naveen legally, and his mother's side of the family named him Yashwanth.[6][a] Yashwanth was chosen as they believed his time of birth astrologically necessitated a name beginning with the letter ಯ (ya).[8] In keeping with a Hindu tradition of giving children a deity's epithet, Yash was described as Nanjundeshwara ("poison-drinker god", referring to Shiva).[8][9] Before starting his acting career, he was advised by others in the industry to adopt a stage name.[10] Desiring to stand out with a name that was unique for an actor in Karnataka, he shortened Yashwanth to Yash.[11]

Yash's father, Arun Kumar Gowda, was a driver for the Karnataka State Road T later the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation. His mother, Pushpa, is a homemaker.[12][13] He has a younger sister, Nandini, who is married to a computer engineer.[13] Yash aspired to be an actor from a young age and actively participated in theatre and dance competitions at his school in Mysore.[12] When he was young, his family also ran a provision store, where he would help out regularly.[14] Yash wanted to quit school and pursue full-time acting after completing grade 10 but had to complete senior school on the demand of his parents.[12] He studied at the Mahajana Education Society for all his school years.[15] His parents initially disapproved of his acting ambitions, and his father wanted him to be a government officer.[14] In 2003, they relented and allowed him to move to Bangalore at the age of 16 to work on a film as an assistant director, but stated that he would not be allowed to go back if he returned.[12] The project was cancelled after only two days of filming, but Yash stayed in Bangalore.[12] He stated he had ₹300 (equivalent to ₹1,100 or US$14 in 2023) with him at the time.[14] He joined a theatre group, the Benaka drama troupe, which was formed by dramatist B. V. Karanth.[16] He worked as a backstage worker and was paid ₹50 (63¢ US) per day.[12]

Yash eventually became a backup actor, and in 2004, portrayed Balarama, the lead role in a play.[12] While still working in theatre, he completed his Bachelor of Arts at Bangalore's K.L.E. College.[15] He made his television debut the same year with the teleserial Uttarayana.[13] In 2005, he was offered a role in the teleserial Nanda Gokula, where he starred alongside Radhika Pandit.[12] He went on to appear in several other teleserials such as T. N. Seetharam's Male Billu and Preeti Illada Mele.[13][12] Once Yash had secured a stable income, his parents moved in with him to Bangalore.[12] During this time, he was offered roles in seven films, but his insistence on having the script for each film made available to him was viewed as "arrogance from a newcomer" and often refused.[12]

Career
Film debut and breakthrough (2008–2012)

Yash debuted in 2007 with a supporting role in Priya Hassan's Jambada Hudugi, which saw him play a man whose infertile wife seeks uterus transplantation.[17] A critic from Indiaglitz wrote that "Yash is very good in his debut".[17] He next played the romantic interest of his Nanda Gokula co-actor Radhika Pandit's character in the teen drama Moggina Manasu (2008), directed by Shashank, which follows the love lives of four girls who become friends in college.[18] He was cast in a last-minute decision after Shashank's initial choice for the role fractured their leg and required rest for six months. Shashank then happened to see Yash in an episode of Preeti Illada Mele and was impressed by his performance. Yash was sporting a beard for Preeti Illada Mele but Shashank reached out to him and convinced him to shave clean for the role.[19] R.G. Vijayasarathy of Rediff.com found the film worked despite its screenplay and highlighted Yash's performance among the male cast as impressive.[18] The role won him the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor in Kannada at the 56th Filmfare Awards South.[20] The film is considered to be Yash's breakthrough project.[13]

Yash then starred in the title role in the romance Rocky (2008) opposite Bianca Desai, playing a college student who has a troubled relationship with his parents.[7] Rocky emerged to be a critical and commercial failure; Vijayasarathy, who found him promising in Jambada Hudugi and Moggina Manasu, wrote that "he looks uncomfortable here, as the role lacks clarity".[7][21] In the first of his two releases in 2009, the Sumana Kittur-directed action drama Kallara Santhe, he played Somu, a post-graduate student and later auto rickshaw driver who is driven to consider suicide.[22][23] To promote the film, he drove the winners of a local contest around Bangalore in an auto rickshaw, an event that attracted media attention.[23] Writing for The New Indian Express, a critic was not impressed with the screenplay: "Though this film showcases contemporary issues such as extra-marital affairs, corruption and nepotism among politicians, the director has not succeeded in presenting them very well."[22] The second release, Prakash's family drama Gokula, featured an ensemble cast including Vijay Raghavendra and Pooja Gandhi. A critic for The Times of India found the film to appeal only to "those who love sentimental stories celebrating the bond between mothers and sons", but appreciated the starring performances, including Yash's.[24] Both Kallara Santhe and Gokula failed to do well commercially.[25]

In 2010, Yash starred in the romantic comedy Modalasala, alongside Bhama. The Daily News and Analysis felt the film had "its funny moments and occasionally, an overdose of sentimental scenes" and highlighted Yash's prowess as a dancer, calling him "easily one of the best we have in Sandalwood".[26] The film was a commercial success, becoming Yash's first solo box office hit.[27] His next release was the crime action Rajadhani (2011), about a group of friends who commit a murder for money and go on the run from a cop played by Prakash Raj.[28] The film failed to meet critical and commercial expectations, with Rediff.com saying that its promising messages were lost in consumerism, but found Yash to be the best performer among the cast: "He puts up a restrained performance and gets to play more than a motor-mouth lover boy."[28][25] The same year, he appeared in Kirataka, a remake of the Tamil-language romantic comedy Kalavani (2010), playing a wayward student who falls in love with his batchmate, played by Oviya.[29][30] Lakshminarayana was appreciative of the film and wrote, "Yash is easily Kannada industry's best brat. The film gives him scope to exhibit his dance moves and at the same time brings out his acting talent."[29] With earnings of ₹30 million domestically, Kirataka was one of the top-grossing Kannada films of 2011.[31]

Yash had three film releases in 2012. The romantic comedy Lucky saw him play Lucky, an aspiring commercial director who gets an unrecognisable makeover and changes his name to Vicky. Vicky tried to woo Gowri (played by Ramya), a radio jockey, but finds that she loves Lucky.[32] Srikanth Srinivasa of Rediff.com commended the "relaxing, feel-good movie," writing, "Yash looks dashing in the second half as the well-behaved Vicky but he is also equally at ease in his earlier avatar as Lucky."[33] In contrast, a critic for the Indo-Asian News Service felt it was dragged down by being "predictable, inconsistent and illogical" and stated Yash "scores well as a dancer," but disliked his chemistry with Ramya.[32] The action romance Jaanu, directed by Preetham Gubbi, followed a hotel owner who must overcome familial pressure to unite with his lover.[34] A critic for the Indo-Asian News Service stated the film was "good for a one-time watch" and appreciated the fight sequences involving Yash.[34] Both Lucky and Jaanu were fairly successful commercially.[35][36] His final release of the year was Yograj Bhat's romantic comedy Drama, starring opposite Radhika Pandit. Shruti I.L. of Daily News and Analysis found the pair to be "a cute on-screen couple" and felt they "liven[ed] up the screen with their effortless performances."[37] It was one of the highest-grossing Kannada films of 2012.[36]
